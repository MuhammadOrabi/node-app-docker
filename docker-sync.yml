  # optional, default: docker-compose-dev.yml if you like, you can set a custom location (path) of your compose file. Do not set it, if you do not want to use it at all

  # optional, maximum number of attempts for unison waiting for the success exit status. The default is 5 attempts (1-second sleep for each attempt). Only used in unison.

    # specific options
    # If you need to sync a lot of files, you can reach out the system limit
    # of inotify watches. You can set the limit by using this parameter. This will
    # prompt you for your sudo password to modify the system configuration.

    # Additional unison options
    # @see http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/download/releases/stable/unison-manual.html#prefs
    # For example, these provided options will automatically resolve conflicts by using the newer version of the file
    # and append a suffix to the conflicted file to prevent its deletion.
    # do not use --copyonconflict or --prefer here, those are handled by the sync_prefer setting
    sync_args: [ '-v' ]
    # Exclude some files / directories that matches **exactly** the path
    # this currently use the the -Path option of unison, use sync_excludes_type to change this behavior
    # see http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/download/releases/stable/unison-manual.html#pathspec for more
    sync_excludes: [ '.git', '.idea', '.vscode' ,'node_modules' ]

    # use this to change the exclude syntax.
    # Path: you match the exact path ( nesting problem )
    # Name: If a file or a folder does match this string ( solves nesting problem )
    # Regex: Define a regular expression
    # none: You can define a type for each sync exclude, so sync_excludes: ['Name .git', 'Path Gemlock']
    #
